     I worked in a data management team in my first job at BNP Paribas. Besides
     performing my core tasks I also created several process automation tools
     using VBA and Excel.

     Next, I worked on a startup that was creating IoT based product whose goal
     was to improve parking spot utilization in city centers. There I was
     working on mobile app development (C#/Xamarin) and the hardware part of the
     product (Raspberry.Pi)

     After the startup, I joined Rocheâ€™s .NET team. There I worked with RPA
     scripts (UIParh) and assisted RPA Platform Architect.

     At that point, I decided to try project management and started working in
     Digitas on the content localization team where I coordinated projects and
     facilitated communication between business and implementation teams.
